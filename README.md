👋 Hi, I’m Konstantin Seravin!

👀 I’m a software developer with a strong focus on backend development, particularly using Python and its rich set of frameworks like FastAPI, Flask and Django.

💞️ I’m an open-minded, cheerful person, always excited to collaborate on projects that make a positive impact.
